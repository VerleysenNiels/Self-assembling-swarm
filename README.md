# Self-assembling-swarm
This is the implementation of my research project for the Multi-Agent Systems course at KU Leuven. In this project I reproduced a self assembling robot swarm in the MASON simulation environment. The system gets a pattern as input and the agents move to reconstruct this pattern.
